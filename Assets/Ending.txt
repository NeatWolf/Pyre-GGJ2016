The Pyre

The beasts of the ocean hated those who live along the shore, and would try often to topple the boats of fishermen, or pull children from the shallows out into the cold waters. One day the beasts conspired to destroy the people of the coast and gathered together all their might to form a great and terrible wave that would sweep away all the villages.

As they charged forth a lone hero waiting in the sands met them, shield in hand. The beasts did not fear the hero, it was small and alone, and they had all the power of the sea, but the hero was brave, and strong, and had the hope of every person of the shore to drive them.

The hero, tiny and alone, braced their shield with all that bravery and strength and hope, and broke the wave upon it.

The beasts retreated, shattered, into the ocean where they stayed forever more.
